# A SmartShunt is a Battery monitor. Therefore the following sensor values are available:

# BATTERY_VOLTAGE in V
# BATTERY_CURRENT in A
# BATTERY_POWER in W
# STATE_OF_CHARGE in %
# CONSUMED_AH in Ah
# AUX_VOLTAGE in V        (*)
# MID_VOLTAGE in V        (*)
# TEMPERATURE in Â°C       (*)
# TIME_TO_GO in minutes

# (*) Available if device aux port is configured.
# The amount of charged and discharged energy is in the field CONSUMED_AH.
# The battery SOC is in the field STATE_OF_CHARGE.
# These are all available fields transmitted by the Victron Battery Shunt. I cannot add additional fields.
