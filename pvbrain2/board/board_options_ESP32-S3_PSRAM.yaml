# This file optimizes the use of the ESP32-S3 PSRAM by authorizing or forcing
# certain data to be written to the PSRAM rather than to the internal RAM.
# The configuration presented here already seems stable for several users and
# visibly offers better behavior of the esp when it contains a lot of entities.
